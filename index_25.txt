The dbt Cloud Job Trigger is used for triggering dbt Cloud jobs.
Create New Configuration
Create a new configuration of the dbt Cloud Job Trigger application.
Then fill in your Account ID, Job ID and API key. You also have the option to choose a custom Cause message to identify the trigger.
It saves the response from triggerRun into the table dbt_cloud_trigger.
If you check the Wait for result option, the component will wait for the job to finish for the maximum time set via the parameter max_wait_time after it has been triggered. Then it will store the result of getRunById into the table dbt_cloud_run. It will also store all available artifacts.
